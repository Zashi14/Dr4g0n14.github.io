    <h1 > DRAGONS</h1>
    <img src="front.jpg" alt="First" >
  
 <p>
    A dragon is a reptilian legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many 
    cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons 
    in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned,
     and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless,
      four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between
       dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian and avian features.
        Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance,
         especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the 
         template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.

 <h2 > MYTH ORIGINS</h2>

  <img src="orig.jpg" alt="Sec">

 <P>  Draconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe and the
     earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures 
     are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient 
     Mesopotamian art and literature. Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur
      throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical 
      draconic creatures include the mushussu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology;
       Vrtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand'Goule in the Poitou region
        in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern, Kulshedra in Albanian Mythology and the Lernaean Hydra
         in Greek mythology; Jormungandr, Niohoggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon
          from Beowulf.

    Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon
     originates from[13] and a wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed.
    
    In his book An Instinct for Dragons (2000), David E. Jones (anthropologist) 
    suggests a hypothesis that humans, like monkeys, have inherited instinctive reactions to
     snakes, large cats, and birds of prey. He cites a study which found that approximately 
     39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes and notes that fear of snakes is especially 
     prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare. The earliest attested dragons 
     all resemble snakes or have snakelike attributes.Jones therefore concludes that dragons 
     appear in nearly all cultures because humans have an innate fear of snakes and other animals
      that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors. Dragons are usually said to reside 
      in "dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests", all places
       which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.
    
    In her book The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman
     Times (2000), Adrienne Mayor argues that some stories of dragons may have been 
     inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to dinosaurs and other prehistoric 
     animals. She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by 
     "observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the Siwalik Hills below 
     the Himalayas" and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the Monster of Troy may have 
     been influenced by fossils of Samotherium, an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are
      common in the Mediterranean region. In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric 
      animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as "dragon bones" and are 
      commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Mayor, however, is careful to point out 
      that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils and notes that
       Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long "been considered
        barren of large fossils." In one of her later books, she states that "Many dragon images
         around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as
          Komodo dragons, Gila monsters, iguanas, alligators, or, in California, alligator lizards,
           though this still fails to account for the Scandinavian legends, as no such animals 
           (historical or otherwise) have ever been found in this region."
    
    Robert Blust in The Origin Of Dragons (2000) argues that, like many other creations of 
    traditional cultures, dragons are largely explicable as products of a convergence of rational 
    pre-scientific speculation about the world of real events. In this case, the event is the natural
     mechanism governing rainfall and drought, with particular attention paid to the phenomenon of
      the rainbow.</P>

  <h2>DRAGONS IN MODERN CULTURE </h2>
  <img src="smgg.jpeg" alt="Modern">
  <p>Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern 
    literature, particularly within the fantasy genre. As early as the 
    eighteenth century, critical thinkers such as Denis Diderot were already asserting 
    that too much literature had been published on dragons: "There are already in books all 
    too many fabulous stories of dragons". In Lewis Carroll's classic children's novel Through
     the Looking-Glass (1872), one of the inset poems describes the Jabberwock, a kind of dragon.
      Carroll's illustrator John Tenniel, a famous political cartoonist, humorously showed
      the Jabberwock with the waistcoat, buck teeth, and myopic eyes of a Victorian university 
      lecturer, such as Carroll himself. In works of comedic children's fantasy, dragons often 
      fulfill the role of a magic fairy tale helper. In such works, rather than being 
      frightening as they are traditionally portrayed, dragons are instead represented as harmless,
       benevolent, and inferior to humans. They are sometimes shown living in contact with 
       humans, or in isolated communities of only dragons. Though popular in the late 
       nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, "such comic and idyllic stories" began to grow 
       increasingly rare after the 1960s, due to demand for more serious children's literature.
     One of the most iconic modern dragons is Smaug from J. R. R. Tolkien's classic novel The Hobbit.
     Dragons also appear in the best-selling Harry Potter series of children's novels by J. K. 
    Rowling. Other prominent works depicting dragons include Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of 
    Pern, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle, George R. R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire, 
    and Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle. Sandra Martina Schwab writes, 
    "With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film Reign of Fire,
     dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the
      more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of
       fantasy. The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, 
       whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional
        gender roles. In children's literature the friendly dragon becomes a powerful ally in
         battling the child's fears." The popular role-playing game system Dungeons & Dragons
          (D&D) makes heavy use of dragons. After recent discoveries in palaeontology,fictional dragons are sometimes 
    represented with no front legs, but (when on the ground) walking on their back feet and the
     wrists of their wings, like pterosaurs did: for example see (in Game of Thrones) and 
     (Smaug, as in the movie)</p>
